Code Refactoring / Horiseon Website

Welcome to Horiseon Social Solution Services Website!

This website was designed with accessibility in mind. Using various semantic elements, and multiple alt attributes, 
this page is optimized for screen readers.It hase been made using semantic HTML elements, navagation links, 
and CSS styling. All which come together to provide a seamless desktop experience when viewing information about Horiseon. 

Example of semantic structure and alt attribute:


"![code refactor example](assets\images\coderefactor example.PNG)"

<main class="services">
        <article id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="a notebook illustrating a diamond labeled content, a chain labeled backlink, a bridge labeled link building, a thumbs up labeled social media, a cell phone labeled mobile compatibility, html heading tags labeled headings surrounded by a cup of pens and pencils, a coffe cup, and a laptop with a magnifying glass resting on the base"/>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </p>
            .
            <article>
                </article>
            .
            <article>
                </article>
            .
            </main>

            In this example the <main> tag refers to the biggest section of content on the page, with each article holding a band of information, navagation links to bring the user directly to the material, and a concise alt attribute describing the image in great detail.
